## About the Project

Vesperon Lunaris is a dedicated online platform designed to serve as an additional learning resource for students and enthusiasts in the exact sciences. This website aims to provide comprehensive and insightful materials particularly focusing on Civil Engineering, alongside fundamental concepts in Basic Physics and Basic Chemistry.

Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding of these subjects through well-structured content and detailed discussions, making complex topics more accessible.

## Features

* Comprehensive articles, explanations, and examples for each subject.
* Dedicated sections covering various aspects of civil engineering.
* Fundamental concepts explained clearly for foundational understanding.
* Designed for easy navigation and optimal readability.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** for structuring the web content.
* **CSS3** for styling and layout.
* **JavaScript** for interactive elements and dynamic content.

## Getting Started

    # Or navigate to the file in your file explorer and double-click it.
    ```

## Usage

Navigate through the website using the sidebar (if implemented) or direct links within the content. The homepage provides an overview, and dedicated sections for Civil Engineering, Basic Physics, and Basic Chemistry contain specific learning materials.

* **Homepage:** `index.html`
* **Civil Engineering:** `civil/index.html`
* **Basic Physics:** `physics/index.html`
* **Basic Chemistry:** `chemistry/index.html`

**Note on Local Usage:** Due to the use of absolute paths in the project's scripts, it is recommended to run this website from the root of a drive (e.g., `D:\` or `E:\`) if you are accessing the files directly from your local file system to ensure all links function correctly.
